# Student Marks Calculator (Java)

**_Project Overview_**

This is a console-based Java program that calculates the total marks, percentage, and grade for a student. The program also validates input to ensure marks are within the range of 0–100, preventing invalid data from being processed.
It demonstrates basic Java concepts like arrays, loops, conditional statements, and input validation.

**_Features_**

- Accepts student name and marks for 5 subjects
- Validates marks to ensure they are between 0 and 100
- Calculates total marks
- Calculates percentage with 2 decimal places
- Determines grade based on percentage:
     - A+ → 90 and above
     - B → 75–89
     - C → 60–74
     - D → 40–59
     - F → below 40
- Stops the program if invalid marks are entered

**Enter marks of Subject-2: 105**
**Error: Invalid marks entered**
The program stops immediately.

**_Technologies Used_**

- Java SE 8+
- Console-based application
- Arrays, loops, and conditional statements

**_Future Enhancements_**

- Allow any number of subjects using dynamic arrays
- Add Pass/Fail message
- Allow re-entry of invalid marks instead of stopping the program
- Add GUI interface for better user interaction
